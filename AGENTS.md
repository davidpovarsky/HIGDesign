HIGDesign Agent Notes

Project Shape

* HIGDesign is an Apple-only SwiftUI design system library that strictly follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines.
* Repository: HIGDesign.
* GitHub: https://github.com/promptdora/HIGDesign
* The library targets all Apple platforms:
    * iOS
    * iPadOS
    * macOS
    * visionOS
    * tvOS
    * watchOS
* The library is built with Apple-native technologies:
    * SwiftUI
    * Swift Package Manager
    * DocC
* Prefer SwiftUI-only APIs in package sources and tests. UIKit or AppKit bridging belongs in `HIGBridging` only when SwiftUI cannot satisfy the requirement.
* Minimum supported OS releases are the latest three calendar years: iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, tvOS 18, watchOS 11, visionOS 2.
* HIGDesign is a reusable design system package, not an application shell.
* Do not add a custom backend, web app, React Native, Flutter, Electron, Firebase, Supabase, or cross-platform UI unless explicitly requested.
* Do not add TCA, SwiftData, CloudKit, or StoreKit unless explicitly requested.

Reference Repositories

* Use these sibling repositories as architecture and implementation references only. Do not copy brand-specific code or naming.
* `../ouds-ios` — layered token architecture, theme contract, modular SPM products, accessibility utilities, DocC and snapshot CI.
* `../SwiftUIX` — `AppKitOrUIKit` abstraction, Cocoa bridging for SwiftUI gaps, cross-platform presentation and scroll primitives.
* `../SwiftUI-Design-System-Pro` — token categories, theme engine concepts, component modifier DSL, accessibility helpers.
* `../promptory-apple` — agent file shape, BA requirements layout, coding standards discipline, HIG review process.

Coding Standards

* Follow `CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
* Do not edit `CODING_STANDARDS.md` unless explicitly asked.
* If any instruction conflicts with `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, ask for clarification before changing architecture or coding style.
* Code agent changes must preserve the mandatory modular SPM architecture and HIG-first design policy.

Dependency Rules

* HIGDesign must remain zero third-party runtime dependencies in the core package.
* Optional bridging code may adapt patterns from SwiftUIX, but do not add a remote SwiftUIX dependency unless explicitly approved.
* Do not use CocoaPods or Carthage.
* Test-only and tooling dependencies such as SwiftLint plugins, SwiftFormat, and swift-docc-plugin require explicit approval.
* Do not vendor third-party code into the package without explicit approval and license review.

Architecture Rules

* Use a layered, acyclic module graph:

HIGFoundations
→ HIGTokensRaw
→ HIGTokensSemantic
→ HIGTokensComponent
→ HIGThemesContract
→ HIGThemesSystem / HIGPlatform / HIGBridging
→ HIGComponents / HIGModifiers
→ exported HIGDesign

* Business-facing API names use the `HIG` prefix.
* Public module products must stay separable so consumers can import only tokens, only components, or the umbrella library.
* Theme resolution belongs in `HIGThemesContract` and theme implementations, not in individual components.
* Components must read design values from `@Environment(\.higTheme)` or component token providers.
* All UI dimensions, colors, opacity, padding, width, height, corner radius, and spacing must come from design tokens — never hardcoded literals in component view code.
* Do not hardcode brand colors, custom font families, or non-system spacing inside components.
* Platform differences belong in `HIGPlatform` or component-specific adapters, not scattered `#if os()` blocks.
* Keep PRs small and module-focused.

Git Workflow (required)

* **Never push directly to `develop` or `main`.** All changes land through pull requests.
* Branch from `develop`: `feature/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`, or `docs/…`.
* Push your branch and open a PR targeting `develop`.
* Wait for CI (`Build and Test`) to pass before merge.
* Squash-merge or merge via GitHub UI after review. Do not fast-forward push to `develop` from a local checkout.
* Release tags (`v*`) are cut from `develop` only after the release PR is merged.

Swift Concurrency Rules

* Use Swift 6 strict concurrency.
* Prefer `Sendable` token structs and protocol requirements where practical.
* Mark UI-facing theme and environment types with `@MainActor` when they touch SwiftUI state.
* Use `async`/`await` only where side effects exist; token and component rendering should stay synchronous unless bridging requires otherwise.
* Do not use GCD or `DispatchQueue`; use Swift concurrency (`Task`, `async`/`await`, actors) instead. Run `Scripts/verify_no_gcd.sh`.

HIGFoundations Rules

* `HIGFoundations` may import Foundation and SwiftUI only when needed for platform typing.
* Do not import component or theme modules from Foundations.
* Accessibility helpers, size classes, idioms, WCAG utilities, and logging belong here.

Token Rules

* Tokens follow a three-layer model inspired by OUDS:
    * Raw — system primitives
    * Semantic — HIG roles such as label, fill, background, accent
    * Component — per-component sizing, padding, radius, and typography
* Raw tokens must map to Apple system values or documented HIG measurements.
* Semantic tokens must be protocol-based so themes can override them.
* Component tokens must not reach into unrelated component categories.
* Token changes require updates to `Requirements/Tokens/REQ.md` in the same change.

Theme Rules

* Every app integration path starts with `HIGThemeableView`.
* `@Environment(\.higTheme)` is required for themed surfaces.
* Missing theme injection is a programmer error and should fail fast in debug builds.
* Built-in themes must support light mode, dark mode, and increased contrast.
* Theme changes require updates to `Requirements/Themes/REQ.md` in the same change.

Showcase Rules

* Showcase and sample apps demonstrate public HIGDesign APIs only; they must not become dependencies of library targets.
* Showcase view code must resolve spacing, padding, colors, typography, corner radius, borders, and opacity from design tokens — not hardcoded literals such as `spacing: 12`, `.quaternary.opacity(0.35)`, or `.font(.headline)`.
* Read visual values from `@Environment(\.higTheme)` (`theme.spacing`, `theme.colors`, `theme.typography`, `theme.card`, component token structs) or approved helpers such as `higPadding`, `HIGSpacing`, and `HIGAccessibility`.
* Reuse shared showcase helpers such as `ShowcaseSurfaceTileView` for token-backed demo surfaces.
* Showcase changes require updates to `Requirements/Showcase/REQ.md` when behavior or demo affordances change.

Component Rules

* Public components use the `HIG` prefix, for example `HIGButton`, `HIGTextField`, `HIGTabBar`.
* Components must support Dynamic Type, Reduce Motion, Increase Contrast, and VoiceOver.
* Components must declare platform availability explicitly when behavior differs by OS.
* Components must not depend on application state, persistence, networking, or StoreKit.
* New components require:
    * REQ acceptance criteria
    * unit or snapshot tests
    * DocC symbol documentation
    * at least one Showcase example
    * a useful `#Preview` in the component source file

Platform Rules

* iOS and iPadOS are first-class targets.
* macOS must support keyboard, pointer, focus, and toolbar conventions.
* visionOS must respect depth, ornaments, and volumetric layout guidance.
* tvOS must support focus engine navigation and large touch targets.
* watchOS must support compact layouts, Digital Crown interactions where relevant, and minimal chrome.
* Use `HIGPlatform` capability flags instead of duplicating platform checks across components.

Bridging Rules

* Native SwiftUI is the default implementation path.
* Bridging belongs in `HIGBridging` and is optional for package consumers.
* Bridged controls must still resolve colors, typography, spacing, and motion from HIG tokens.
* Prefer not to expose raw UIKit or AppKit types in public HIG component APIs.
* UIKit or AppKit representables and imports are allowed only in `HIGBridging` when SwiftUI cannot satisfy the requirement. Document the justification in the PR.

Requirements Documentation Rules

* When adding requirements, changing requirements, or implementing behavior that changes an existing requirement, update the relevant document in `Requirements/` in the same change.
* Keep these docs current:
    * `Docs/PRD.md`
    * `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
    * `Docs/AGENT_RULES.md`
    * `Requirements/README.md`
    * the affected `Requirements/*/REQ.md`
* If implementation changes architecture, update `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
* If implementation changes public API or HIG behavior, update `Docs/PRD.md` and the relevant `REQ.md`.

Design Rules

* Apple Human Interface Guidelines are the source of truth for visuals and interaction.
* Check `Docs/UI_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` before changing public components or modifiers.
* Prefer system colors, SF Pro text styles, SF Symbols, and native SwiftUI controls.
* Do not introduce custom brand themes unless they are implemented as explicit `HIGTheme` conformances.
* Renderable design references live under `Design/`.
* Start UI work from `Design/hig-design-system.html` or the matching page in `Design/hig/pages/`.

Xcode Preview Rules

* Every public `struct SomeView: View` component must have its own useful, type-named `#Preview` in `SomeView.swift`.
* Preview names must begin with the exact type name, for example `#Preview("HIGButton — Primary")`.
* Previews must use deterministic mock themes and must not depend on live network, file system, or app targets.
* Run `Scripts/verify_xcode_previews_present.sh` for every SwiftUI change.
* Run `Scripts/verify_view_naming.sh` for every SwiftUI change.

Apple HIG UI Rule

* All public components and modifiers must follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines.
* Agents must check `Docs/UI_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` before changing UI.
* If changing UI, include a HIG checklist summary in the PR body.
* Do not add cramped controls, non-native layouts, or custom chrome without justification.
* Accessibility is mandatory, not optional.

Logging Rules

* Use `HIGLogger` or the shared logging helper from `HIGFoundations`.
* Do not scatter raw `print` statements through library code.
* Debug logging may describe component name, platform, theme name, and configuration enums.
* Do not log user-entered text, secrets, or private app content.
* Library logging stays local unless remote logging is explicitly requested.

Development Environment Rules

* Target Xcode 16 or newer; CI should verify the latest stable Xcode practical for all six platforms.
* Swift 6 language mode is required.
* Document toolchain changes in `Docs/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md`.
* Do not claim verification passed unless the relevant command was actually run successfully.
* **`swift test` alone is not enough.** It builds the package for the host (macOS) and will not catch iOS-only sample / Showcase compile failures (for example unguarded `Color(nsColor:)`).
* After any change under `Showcase/`, `Sample/`, or multi-platform `Sources/`, agents **must** run the sample iOS + macOS gate before marking work done:
  * `Scripts/verify_platform_api_guards.sh` (fast static check)
  * `Scripts/verify_sample_xcode_project.sh` (builds `HIGDesignSample` iOS Simulator **and** `HIGDesignSampleMac`)
* Preferred one-shot local PR gate: `Scripts/verify_local_pr.sh` (static guards + `swift test` + sample iOS/macOS builds).
* Never claim “sample builds” or “verification passed” unless those commands were actually executed successfully in this session.

Verification Commands

**Required before opening a PR (or finishing multi-platform UI work):**

```bash
Scripts/verify_local_pr.sh
```

Equivalent expanded form:

```bash
Scripts/verify_platform_api_guards.sh
swift test
Scripts/verify_sample_xcode_project.sh   # iOS Simulator + macOS sample
```

Full package multi-SDK build (slower; run when touching Package.swift or cross-platform core):

```bash
Scripts/build_all_platforms.sh
```

Showcase snapshot capture (`Scripts/capture_showcase_snapshots.sh`) is manual for README/Pages images only.

Individual guards (debugging):

```bash
Scripts/verify_requirements_present.sh
Scripts/verify_ui_guidelines_present.sh
Scripts/verify_xcode_previews_present.sh
Scripts/verify_view_naming.sh
Scripts/verify_component_token_usage.sh
Scripts/verify_showcase_token_usage.sh
Scripts/verify_platform_api_guards.sh
Scripts/verify_photo_picker_token_usage.sh
Scripts/verify_photo_editor_token_usage.sh
Scripts/verify_no_gcd.sh
Scripts/verify_no_uikit.sh
swift build --package-path .
swift test --package-path .
```

Current Milestone

Current milestone: v1.6.0 released (2026-07-15).

v1.6.0 delivered Showcase Components/Pages tabs, complex application page recipes, feedback Extend parity, and HIGImageFrame layout fixes. See `Docs/PRD.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

Next milestone: opportunistic platform polish and consumer app work; core Extend rows closed post-v1.5.0.

## Living Project Board

`PROJECT_BOARD.md` is this repository's shared living project board. Before starting substantial work, scan it for relevant context. During normal work, agents should proactively add concise, actionable entries when they discover something with genuine future value, including:

- useful technical discoveries
- optimization opportunities
- implementation tricks
- architectural ideas
- possible future improvements
- experiments worth running
- unresolved issues or questions
- follow-up work that should not be lost

Do this proactively even when the discovery is incidental to the current task. Do not add trivial observations, temporary debugging chatter, information already documented elsewhere, generic suggestions with no project relevance, or every step performed during a task. The board supports memory but is not a source of truth when repository code, documentation, or current state contradicts it.

When an item is implemented, mark it complete and optionally record the date and commit/PR, moving it to `Done` when useful. Delete or archive obsolete entries when appropriate.

Updating `PROJECT_BOARD.md` as a side effect of another task is allowed and encouraged when a worthwhile discovery is made. Recording an idea is allowed; implementing unrelated ideas is not.

Preserve all existing repository-specific instructions.
